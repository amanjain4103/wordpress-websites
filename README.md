# About Wordpress Blog

## Description 
In this wordpress website I have created a technical blogging website as named **tech on tips** which is based on my personal blogging website on blogger(from google). I added carousals, banners, navbars, sidebar widgets and a nice footer which all add up to a great-looking blog website. This website focuses more on blogs rather than irrelevant stuff. Since it is a wordpress website so the owner can now more focus on writing blog and creating good content while all UI is taken cared by wordpress. I have used several plugins and themes like wp-forms, smtp, maps and much more which makes this website fully functional and adorable. Best part of blogging is good blogging websites can drive you more passive income. Blogging websites are the biggest use cases of wordpress with its great CMS.
