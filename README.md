# About Wordpress Blog

## Description 
In this wordpress website I have created a technical blogging website as named **tech on tips** which is based on my personal blogging website on blogger(from google). I added carousals, banners, navbars, sidebar widgets and a nice footer which all add up to a great-looking blog website. This website focuses more on blogs rather than irrelevant stuff. Since it is a wordpress website so the owner can now more focus on writing blog and creating good content while all UI is taken cared by wordpress. I have used several plugins and themes like wp-forms, smtp, maps and much more which makes this website fully functional and adorable. Best part of blogging is good blogging websites can drive you more passive income. Blogging websites are the biggest use cases of wordpress with its great CMS.

1. Get a hosting
    * take your cloud provider hosting because the exported size is big.(I use AWS)
    * create a linux virtual machine and setup the wordpress
1. access your linux virtual machine(vm) on cloud
    * now access your vm terminal and get root access
    * make configuration on vm to increase import size (>16mb)
    * if you don't know how to do either search on internet, or you can also contact me otherwise you have to make the whole site from scratch.
    * Now chill we are almost done
1. admin panel

    * search for *all in one wp migration*, install and activate it.
    * now on the left sidebar of your dashboard there should be a new tab named *all in one wp migration*, go ahead and click on it.
    * Since I have exported the wordpress site as a file so you should click on import and **as a file** 
    * Now remember we cloned this repository earlier observe there we have a exported file named **wordpress-blog-site-export.wpress**
    * So import this file in your wordpress
### And Bammmmmm........ your site must be live !!!
