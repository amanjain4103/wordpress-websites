# About Wordpress Blog

## Description 
In this wordpress website I have created a technical blogging website as named **tech on tips** which is based on my personal blogging website on blogger(from google). I added carousals, banners, navbars, sidebar widgets and a nice footer which all add up to a great-looking blog website. This website focuses more on blogs rather than irrelevant stuff. Since it is a wordpress website so the owner can now more focus on writing blog and creating good content while all UI is taken cared by wordpress. I have used several plugins and themes like wp-forms, smtp, maps and much more which makes this website fully functional and adorable. Best part of blogging is good blogging websites can drive you more passive income. Blogging websites are the biggest use cases of wordpress with its great CMS.

# About Wordpress Landing Page

## Description 
In this wordpress website I have created a landing page for imaginary coding bootcamp company coding mountain. In this Landing page I have show off company's alumni network and success rate to stand out among the competetion and furthur have marketed its bootcamp plans amid loackdown. I have added a nice bump up jumbotron on front to hook anyone on the site and then I placed different carousals , cards and banners about alumni network to show the company results and added a call to action button so that when they are attracted they can directly take a action.I have also added additional about page, services page and contact page and a cool Take action button that tooks all the attention. And if they are impressed with that mind blowing website then they will contact you with contact form which mails the details of form to your personal mail. When it comes to responsiveness then the small screen users are going to fall in love with that landing page. Responsiveness allows the company owner to get more reach because it mostly targets students section or a busy guy who search for cources in hisspare time.

# About Wordpress Portfolio Site

## Description 
In this wordpress website I have created a technical portfolio website of none other than tony stark( my idol ). In this portfolio I have tried to sell and market tony stark as a developer and a weapon master. I have added a cool banner, an about section, skills section with smooth progress bars, services section, an Experience section, and a cool filterable recent works gallery where his recent projects are exposed.I have also added pricing plans on hourly, contract based and monthly based plans and a cool client and reviews section is doing the work of cherry in cake. And if they are impressed with that mind blowing website then they will contact you with contact form which mails the details of form to your personal mail. When it comes to responsiveness then the small screen users are going to fall in love with that portfolio. Responsiveness allows the portfolio owner to be hired by even a busy guy who hires people directly from his smartphone.
